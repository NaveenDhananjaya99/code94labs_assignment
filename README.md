This is a sample app for the currency converter.
https://fastforex.readme.io/reference/get_fetch-all? used this open api to calculate the values 

## Getting Started

## Important 
Please make sure to generate a free API key at https://console.fastforex.io/#. 
Then, add that key to the api_key in the utils/constants/api_constant.dart file.

After that, simply run the Flutter project as usual.

Let me know if there's anything else you need help with! ðŸ˜€
